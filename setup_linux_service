# Notes regarding setting up a service on a linux server.

How to setup services: https://www.golinuxcloud.com/beginners-guide-systemd-tutorial-linux/

I have to create a Unit file describing the service I want to run and the criteria for 

## Creating an python environment.
1) I need cryptography. This is only available in arm as python-cryptography. 

`pacman -S python-cryptography`
`pacman -S python-numpy`
`pacman -S python-pytest`

2) This only adds cryptography to global python. I need a venv which includes this global package.
3) Create new env with `python -m venv shyft --system-site-packages`. This creates an env that has access to the global packaes.
4) Any new packages installed will be limited to the venv.
5) Installed shyft.
6) Fix installation of weather module. Can't find packages. DONE!
7) Install packages, run tests, fix tests, run tests, pass!
8) Add encrypted env vars, run tests, all pass!
9) Create startup bash bash /home/shyft/config/weather_dtss_start.bash.
10) I works!
11) Create client from Pycharm terminal on laptop, send request to RPI. MUTHER FUCKING WORKS!
12) Next, start parallell services for data collection and dtss_host.

Created shyft

The following files define services that will start when startup is completed (but before user is logged in).

Place the files in:
/lib/systemd/system/

Assumes that the correct env in venv is called _shyft.

dtss_host.service:
[Unit]
Description=DtssHost for collecting, storing and serving timeseries data.
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/_shyft/bin/python3.8 /home/shyft/start_dtss_host_service.py
StandardInput=tty-force

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target




data_collection_netatmo.service:
[Unit]
Description=Data collection service collecting data from Netatmo.
After=dtss_host.service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/_shyft/bin/python3.8 /usr/shyft/start_data_collection_netatmo.py
StandardInput=tty-force

[Install]
WantedBy=dtss_host.service
